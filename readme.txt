The Custom Pointers Plugin for WordPress introduces an administrative interface that enables Administrators to create a "Collection" custom "Pointers" quickly, easily and in an organized fashion.

Fundamentally; it's a way to create interactive tutorials for your WordPress Users in the back end.

This is built atop the "Feature Pointers" feature that was introduced in WordPress 3.3.

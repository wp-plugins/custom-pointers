== Description ==

The WP Custom Pointers plugin introduces an administrative interface that allows users to create a "Collection" custom "Pointers" quickly and easily in an organized fashion. Fundamentally, it's a way to allow its users the ability to create in-site training tutorials for their variety of purposes. This is built atop the "Feature Pointers" feature that was introduced in WordPress 3.3.
